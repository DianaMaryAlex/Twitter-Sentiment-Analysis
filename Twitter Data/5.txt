This fee is for non event days only.@KielLuhning @CityofRegina I am a little confused about it. Last year it was $500 for license and $600 for Plaza (if you wanted Plaza).@KielLuhning @CityofRegina So I don't understand what the 3x number is about. There are some extra fees yes. They don't need these to vend@KielLuhning @CityofRegina at the Market. They do however pay a flat yearly fee and then a per lineal foot per Market fee after that.@CityofRegina still a big mess of snow with folks getting stuck Sunninghill crescent curve.
