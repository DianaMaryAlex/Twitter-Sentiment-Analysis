And, i am glad that"@austintexasgov that you (European White American controlled City Governemtn) remembered that you mockingly named it THE NEGRO DISTRICT"@austintexasgov back in the late 1920s because I am going to use this discriminative weapon against you.  Also, with the City Government as""@austintexasgov an anonymous partner, the University of Texas sent a Professor MICHAEL HOLLERMAN and two graduate students, ANDRE ROBERTS"@austintexasgov and JENNIE MINNER to our African American Black George Washington Carver Library/Museum to tell a select group of Blacks@austintexasgov that a UT Wiki study that claimed that the African American Blacks are extinct in The Negro District of East Austin.  This"@austintexasgov advanced LIE that you are trying to convince Blacks, who are in the old Negro District/East Austin or whom have left their""@austintexasgov native homeland, will not prevail.  I get angry everytime I hear a native African American Black East Austinite say ...ITS""@austintexasgov ALREADY DONE, THEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER.  Ignorance is a killer.  People are psychologically dying and don't understand""@austintexasgov that they have the sovereign power to stop it.  God said that HE WILL PASS A CURSE OF THE FATHER, DOWN TO THE THIRD OR""@austintexasgov FOURTH GENERATION.  That CURSE exist because of ignorance.  But, His Living Word (Jesus, The Christ) said ...IT IS THE""@austintexasgov SPIRIT THAT QUICKENTH (GIVES LIFE); THE FLESH PROFITETH NOTHING.  THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, THEY ARE SPIRIT, AND THEY"@austintexasgov ARE LIFE (John 6:63).  The African American Black community energy is coming back because God told me to prophesy to THE"@austintexasgov DRY BONE ARMY IN THE VALLEY and He will cause BREATH TO ENTER INTO YOU, THESE BONES, AND YE SHALL LIVE.  I WILL LAY SINEWS""@austintexasgov UPON YOU, AND WILL BRING UP FLESH UPON YOU, AND COVER YOU WITH SKIN, AND PUT BREATH IN YOU, AND YE SHALL LIVE; AND YE""@austintexasgov SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD... i BEHELD (SAW), LO, THE SINEWS AND FLESH CAME UP UPON THEM, AND THE SKIN COVERED THEM ABOVE""@austintexasgov BUT THERE WAS NO BREATH (the Holy Ghost) IN THEM.  HE SAID PROPHESY UNTO THE WIND (the Holy Ghost), PROPHESY, SON OF MAN""@austintexasgov ( a son made of flesh). AND SAY TO THE WIND, THUS SAITH THE LORD GOD: COME FROM THE FOUR WINDS, O BREATH, AND BREATHE UPON""@austintexasgov THESE SLAIN, THAT THEY MAY LIVE.  SO I PROPHESIED AS HE COMMANDED ME, AND THE BREATH CAME INTO THEM, AND THEY LIVED, AND""@austintexasgov STOOD UP UPON THEIR FEET, AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT ARMY.  As Joseph told his brothers ...WHAT YOU MEANT FOR EVIL, GOD MEANT IT""@austintexasgov FOR GOOD.  As my Mother was about to deliver me; her brother (Willie Ray Davis, first Black fireman of Texas) was driving""@austintexasgov her urgently to Holy Cross Hospital, just about 4 blocks from our resident; she said that they almost had to deliver me in""@austintexasgov the bed of the truck.  I came into existence in (The Old Negro District) African American Black East Austin.  Ask Mr. Tang,"@austintexasgov where is he from; they probably miss him.  He probably need to get to his homeland (wherever that is).Cap City Chamber Daily is out! http://t.co/oQRefsYHMq Stories via @childcare24hr @austintexasgov"Golfing ain't easy, but it's necessary.
